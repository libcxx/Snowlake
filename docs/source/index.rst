Snowlake Documentation
======================

Snowlake is both a declarative language for defining static type inference
rules of programming languages, as well as a compiler-compiler that can
synthesize such inference rule definitions into code used for static type
checking, typically used for semantic analysis in language compilers.

The goals of Snowlake are to:

* Provide a flexible declarative language that is able to define the static
  type inference rules of most programming languages.
* Facilitate language developers in defining, documenting and sharing the
  set of type inference rules of any particular language.
* Alleviate the burden on language developers from implementing type
  checking logic that are usually extremely complex, tedious and error-prone.
