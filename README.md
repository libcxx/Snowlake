## Overview

*Snowlake* is both a declarative language for defining static type inference
rules of programming languages, as well as a *compiler-compiler* that can
synthesize such inference rule definitions into code used for static type
checking, typically used for semantic analysis in language compilers.

The goals of *Snowlake* are to:

  1. Provide a flexible declarative language that is able to define the static
     type inference rules of most programming languages.
  2. Facilitate language developers in defining, documenting and sharing
     the set of type inference rules of any particular language.
  3. Alleviate the burden on language developers from implementing type
     checking logic that are usually extremely complex, tedious and error-prone.
